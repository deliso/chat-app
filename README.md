##Codeworks Coding Assingment - January 2022

Odyssey is a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

It’s a page that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (like WhatsApp, but with an Ancient Greece flavour).

I used 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.

**Basic Features**

•	On one side the computer generates a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.

•	The screen automatically flows and follows the messages posted, like in all chat apps.

•	Each message has an indication time it was sent. The date is displayed on top of the chat as it looked better that way. 

**Additional Features**

•	All messages are stored into a chat history that can be deleted by the user.

•	Search (coming soon ...)
