I built a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

It’s a page that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp).

**Features**

•	On one side the computer generates a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.

•	The screen automatically flows and follows the messages posted, like in all chat apps.

•	Each message has an indication of the date and time it was sent.

•	My CSS is clean.

•	I used 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.
